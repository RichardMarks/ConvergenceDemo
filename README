ConvergenceDemo

A demonstration of convergence AI.

You are given a "player" marker to control and many enemies will converge on your location.

History:
Originally a C DOS VGA demonstration by Andre LaMothe, I ported the demo to Python using PyGame in 2006.
I then ported the demo from Python to C++ using Allegro in 2009.
In 2010, I ported the demo to AS3 using FlashPunk.

Now in 2011, I've re-written this demo and have placed it on Github for anyone to use.
